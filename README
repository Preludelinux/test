Hello Everyone 
Preludelinux's layout for Port T of TA build of freeems.

TO-DO 
1. check to see if what im doing is right.~

2. *COMPLETED (edited MOSFET_N into IGBT) Find IGBT for layout and replace mosfet_n with it.~

3. Complete igbt ignition driver circuit.~

4. Use ravage for other inputs and outputs.~

5. Check to see if i can use power reg on TA card for its power use extra to power inputs/ouputs.~
